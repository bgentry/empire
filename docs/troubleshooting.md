### x509: certificate signed by unknown authority with docker-compose

If you are encountering this error with using docker-compose and boot2docker,
you need to disable TLS on boot2docker. Here is how to do so:

1. Set DOCKER_TLS in boot2docker VM
  ```console
  # ssh to boot2docker from host machine (OSX)
  boot2docker up
  boot2docker ssh

  # add DOCKER_TLS=no
  sudo vi /var/lib/boot2docker/profile # should only contain DOCKER_TLS=no

  # exit from boot2docker vm
  exit

  # restart the boot2docker vm
  boot2docker restart
  ```

2. Set the docker environment variables on the host machine
  ```console
  eval "$(boot2docker shellinit)"
  ```

### Deleting an Empire CloudFormation stack

If you've created an Empire CloudFormation stack and deployed an app to it, you have created an ECS Service with an attached ELB inside the VPC of your Empire stack. Before you can delete the stack, you must no longer have any services or ELBs running inside of it. You can do this by running `emp destroy <app>` for each app in your Empire cluster.

Alternatively, you can [manually delete them][deletingaservice] in the Amazon console. After that, make sure you've deleted the ELB associated with the service as well. Once all dependent ECS Services and ELBs have removed from the VPC of Empire stack, you should be able to delete the stack from the CloudFormation console.
